# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**project structure**

This project is a responsive design which means the content structure changes depending on the device it is being accessed on i.e
tablect, computer, and mobile device.

The figma design also has images and buttons that were downloaded from the original design and were converted, so the project would have enough space.
Fonts were also linked to the css.
